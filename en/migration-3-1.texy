Migrating to Version 3.1
************************

Minimum required PHP version is 7.2.

Always update gradually, so not from Nette 2.4 to 3.1, but first to 3.0 and then to 3.1.

Before testing we recommend to disable reporting `E_USER_DEPRECATED` and allow it when everything will work:

```php
$configurator->enableTracy();
error_reporting(~E_USER_DEPRECATED); // note ~ before E_USER_DEPRECATED
```
